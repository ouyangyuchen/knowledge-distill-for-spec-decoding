# CS-552 — submit an interactive RCP job with Jupyter Lab.
#
# ============================================================
#  STEP 1  — set your Gaspar username and team group ID below
#            (both REQUIRED)
# ============================================================
#
# Usage:
#   ./submit.sh                # default: 1 GPU, suffix "lab"
#   ./submit.sh train          # custom job suffix
#
# Once the pod is Running, connect in one of these ways:
#
# 1. Jupyter Lab:
#   runai port-forward <job-name> --port 8888:8888
#   then open http://localhost:8888 (token: cs552).
#   This is a command you run after submission; no submit-time service
#   type is needed.
#
# 2. Shell:
#   runai bash <job-name>
#   Useful for CLI work, package checks, nvidia-smi, or debugging without
#   opening Jupyter.
#
# 3. VS Code:
#   Use the Kubernetes extension to attach VS Code to the running pod
#   named <job-name>-0-0. Open your repo folder inside the pod and use
#   Terminal -> New Terminal for a shell in the same environment.
#
# NOTE: GPU count is fixed at 1 (40GB A100). The course quota is one GPU
# per group allocation; asking for more will leave the job stuck Pending.

>>> Job submitted: ${JOB_NAME}

Watch it start:    runai describe job ${JOB_NAME}
Stream logs:       runai logs -f ${JOB_NAME}
When Running:      runai port-forward ${JOB_NAME} --port 8888:8888
Then open:         http://localhost:8888  (token: cs552)
Shell in pod:      runai bash ${JOB_NAME}
Stop the job:      runai delete job ${JOB_NAME}

Other connection options:
  Jupyter Lab:
    Wait until the job is Running, use the port-forward command above,
    then open http://localhost:8888.
    This is best for notebooks, plots, and milestone work.

  Shell:
    runai bash ${JOB_NAME}
    This is useful for nvidia-smi, checking files, installing a temporary
    package, or running scripts without opening Jupyter.

  VS Code:
    In VS Code, install the Microsoft Kubernetes and Remote Development
    extensions. In the Kubernetes sidebar, find pod ${JOB_NAME}-0-0 and
    choose "Attach Visual Studio Code". Then open your repo folder inside
    the pod and use Terminal -> New Terminal for a shell.

WHEN YOU'RE DONE: \`runai delete job ${JOB_NAME}\`. Idle sessions
take a GPU away from the rest of the course.

Storage inside the pod:
  /scratch             team scratch — your group's primary workspace, RW
  /shared-ro/datasets  course datasets (read-only)
  /shared-ro/models    course models   (read-only)
  /shared-rw           shared with ALL students — be careful what you write

Deliverable notebooks:
  Keep individual_notebooks/*.ipynb in your git repo and commit them.
  Use /scratch for caches, checkpoints, and large generated files, not
  as the only place where milestone notebooks exist.
